    <p>Hey! I'm BenXCool!
       I'm the guy that runs BenXCool Studios and does the Game Development.
       Supposedly, im the guy that only creates chaos.. which may be true.. 
       I got into game dev pretty early in my life, i was fascinated by the Idea of GameDev.
       Playing games was one of my favourite hobbies, and then when i found out how easy it is to make my own, i was amazed.
       I currently code in: HTML, CSS, JS and Lua, but i am always up for more languages.

       I am the top artist of BenXCool Studios.
       I created most of the entities in Abyssal Descent, because.. yeah.
       ANYWAYS, I mostly also created the lore for the entities, and so on.
       I've certainly loved drawing monsters at the age of 6.
       My parents were always horrified by my drawings, but I pretty much liked them.
       Scratch is actually inspired by one of my old drawings!
       I kept drawing and drawing till my monsters looked so horrible, that my teachers even got trauma from me!
       Anyways.. that's all!!! BYE</p>
